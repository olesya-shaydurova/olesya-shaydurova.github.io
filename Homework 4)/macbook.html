            Designed for those who defy limits and change the world,
            the 16-inch MacBook Pro is by far the most powerful notebook
            we have ever made. With an immersive Retina display, superfast
            processors, advanced graphics, the largest battery capacity ever
            in a MacBook Pro, Magic Keyboard, and massive storage, it's the
            ultimate pro notebook for the ultimate user.

            MacBook Pro features a stunning <b>16-inch Retina display</b> — the
            largest Retina display ever in a Mac notebook. It produces <b>500
            nits of brightness</b> for spectacular highlights and bright whites,
            while delivering deep blacks thanks to the precise photo alignment of
            liquid crystal molecules. And the <b>P3 wide color</b> gamut enables
            brilliant, true-to-life images and video. So no matter where you
            are, you’ll see your work in the best possible light.

            A mirrorlike enhanced reflector sheet in the backlight reflects
            over 98 percent of incident light, allowing MacBook Pro to achieve
            500 nits of brightness efficiently. An Apple-patented metal layer
            in the TFT maximizes the transmittance of the pixels, enhancing
            brightness and color uniformity while reducing pixel cross-talk,
            which can cause visual artifacts. The oxide thin film transistor
            (TFT) features 10 times faster pixel charging than the traditional
            amorphous silicon TFT, and holds the pixel voltage steady during
            low-frequency power-saving modes, enabling pin-sharp resolution and
            longer battery life.
